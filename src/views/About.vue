          <p>My name is Andrew Groe and I'm a software developer from Orlando, Florida.
            When I'm not developing, I enjoy cooking, building custom PCs, riding and fixing motorcycles, going to breweries with friends, and playing video games.
            I focus mainly on web and native mobile app development but I'm constantly learning new languages and technologies.
            I've always been a natural problem solver.
            In fact, my first words were actually "I fix it", so I feel it's sort of ingrained in me to ask why and how things work.
            I'm sort of the go-to troubleshooting guy for anyone I know that has a tech-related problem (blessing and a curse).
            As such, I've been building, fixing, repurposing, and modifying computers since I was a kid.
            Sometimes as tech support for other people.
            Sometimes so I could install Linux on an old laptop or macOS on an unsupported pc.</p>

          <p>
            Since I've spent my whole life around computers, I tend to pick up new tech quickly.
            However, that alone isn't enough to cope with how fast technology changes.
            One technique that's helped me adapt to the changing landscape of software development is Just In Time learning.
            I can't remember where I first heard the phrase but it's a fairly well-known technique to not overwhelm yourself with learning unnecessary things.
            Simply put, I tend to focus more on solving the problem than learning a new language or framework for the sake of it.
          </p>

          <p>My first real foray into freelance web development was in the form of static sites consisting of HTML, CSS, and JS; either built from scratch or via bootstrap.
            Needless to say, this got tedious really fast.
            It was around this time that Android really started taking off and since I already had some experience with Java, I decided to give it a shot.
            Fast forward a bit and I began to feel like the Android SDK was, for lack of a better term, incomplete.
            I was tired of jumping through hoops and importing 3rd party libraries just to do basic things like hiding or showing the onscreen keyboard.
            It was at this point that I took another look at JavaScript and it looked a lot different than I remembered.
            With the syntactic sugar and new features ES6+ brought, the language had definitely matured since I last used it.
            Once I saw how succinct and flexible modern JS can be I was instantly hooked.
